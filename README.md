PANDA is a smart pillbox that reminds you when to take your medicine! Using the web interface, you can tell PANDA when to remind you. PANDA can take either a list of times or set period between reminders.

Once it is time to take your medication, PANDA will start beeping and light up the indicator next to the medicine you need to take. The only way to quiet PANDA is to open the box, so there is no chance you will forget to take your medicine. In addition, PANDA remembers if you took your medicine already. If the light is red, you know you don't need to take the pill again. 

# Motivation

Everyone has taken medications at some point in their life. According to a report by the [Kaiser Family Foundation](http://kff.org/other/state-indicator/total-retail-rx-drugs/), over 4 billion prescriptions were filled in 2014. Maybe it was antibiotics for an infection, statins for managing cholesterol levels, or just daily vitamins or supplements. What is in common for all of these medications is that they need to be taken at regular intervals for an extended period of time. 

Based on my own personal experience and the experiences of my parents and other people around me, I know the worry and frustration involved in keeping track of when to take medication. It is easy to forget to take a pill in the morning, or even worse, to accidentally take an extra dose. When someone is sick, the last thing they want to be worrying about is when to take their vital medications.

I first tackled this probelm with a partner during the Fall 2015 HackPrinceton hackathon. We developed PANDA, a smart, user-friendly pillbox powered by Electric Imp. PANDA can be configured remotely with a web interface, after which it will automatically notify the user whenever it is time to take medicine. After the hackathon, I extended PANDA to create PANDA v2, overhauling the user interface and backend software as well as expanding the physical PANDA device. A basic overview of the technical details under the hood of PANDA is provided in the sections below.

# Hardware

PANDA is built around the Electric Imp platform. All processing is done by the imp001 module held in an April breakout board. A ribbon cable connects the pins of the April breakout board to a header on the protoboard where the other components are soldered.

## Analog Electronics

PANDA uses a CdS photocell to detect if the lid is open or not based on the brightness change. This photocell is read using an analog input on the Electric Imp using a 1kÎ© resistor on the high side in a voltage divider configuration. Note that since the photocell's resistance decreases with increasing light level, the analog voltage read by the Electric Imp **decreases** when the light level increases. A DAC pin is used to drive the piezo speaker (Sparkfun COM-07950) using a fixed frequency PWM signal. PANDAv2 includes a transistor to increase the amount of current used to drive the piezo speaker. PANDA is powered by a 4xAA battery holder hooked into the battery input (P+/-) pads on the Electric Imp.

## Medicine LEDs
Each medicine slot has a corresponding bicolor common-anode LED which lights up green if the medicine should be taken and red if the medicine should not be taken. These LEDs are controlled through a 74HC595n shift register driven using one of the Electric Imp's hardware SPI busses. The advantage of the shift register is that it allows the number of LEDs to be increased despite the limited number of GPIO pins. Shift registers can also be easily chained to drive very large numbers of LEDs. By writing a 1 to the bit corresponding to the green or red cathode of the LED, the LED will light with the desired color. Similarly, writing a 0 turns off the LED at that bit. A simple shift register class and LED classes have been created to handle LED toggling.

The enclosure for PANDA is a repurposed cardboard box, with the dividers for the electronics and medicine created from thinner recycled cardstock. The PANDA logos were printed out using a standard color printer and glued onto the enclosure. Overall, the mechanical design was aimed at reducing cost and reusing available materials whenever possible.

The current iteration of PANDA is also designed to allow the connection of a Nokia 5110 LCD (Sparkfun LCD-10168), using pin # as a chip select, driving the control lines using the shift register, and using the same SPI bus used for the shift register for data transfer. However, the LCD unit I originally planed to use had a mechanical defect which caused unreliable connections between the LCD module and the breakout board. Because I didn't have a reliable unit to test my code with, I decided to work on other parts of PANDA due to time constraints. The code for driving the LCD has been left in the repository under the branch lcd. 

# Software

PANDA can be configured using a [web interface](http://ag6gr.github.io/PANDA/), created using Bootstrap and Javascript. The web interface communicates with the Electric Imp servers using http requests. Timekeeping, request handling, and alert triggering are managed by the server side of the Electric Imp. The device is notified of alerts using the standard message passing functionality built into the Electric Imp platform. Source code is available on [Github](https://github.com/AG6GR/PANDA).

## Web Interface

The main page fetches the time of the next dose using GET requests. The configuration page uses POST requests, with the configuration paramemters passed through the URL query string and the name/description of the prescription passed in the body of the POST request.
